# BrowserHistoryAnalyzer-475-2161_Anthony_Schade
This tool will pull, analyze, and display browser history from different browsers in an easy to read format. 
It will integrate a simple interactive map using templates from d3js.org. It will sort and visually produce 
output based on various factors such as website name or time. Plans are in place to integrate a search feature
that would take in a website name and return information on said website (ie. Was it accessed? When? How many times?). 
Time permitting, the program might highlight malicious or illegal searches and websites based on user input.
